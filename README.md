## Project Overview

### A paired project showing understanding of the connections between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  People say that romance novels are formulaic.  Well, maybe that's true.  Created romance novel covers with the following functionality:
- When the page loads, we should see a cover with a randomly selected image, title, and tagline which includes two random descriptors
- Every time the user clicks the Show New Random Cover button, a new random cover is created
- Every time the user clicks the Show New Random Cover button, the random cover is displayed
- When a user clicks the Make Your Own Cover button, we should see the form, and the homepage view should be hidden
- When a user clicks the View Saved Covers button, we should see the saved covers section, and the homepage view should be hidden
- The user should be able to switch between the three views: main cover, form, and saved covers section on correct button clicks
- In the new cover form view, users should be able to fill out the four input fields and then hit the Make my book button
- Switch back to the main homepage (hidden form view)
- Display the newly created cover image, title, and descriptors in the main cover
- When a user clicks the Save Cover button, the current cover will be saved to the View Saved Covers section
- If a user clicks the Save Cover button more than once on a single cover, it will still only save once (no duplicates)
- When a user clicks the View Saved Covers button, we should see the saved covers section
- All covers in Saved Covers array displayed in the saved covers grid section
